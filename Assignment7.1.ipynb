    "Web Application Development:\n",
    "Flask is designed for building web applications, and it provides a simple and modular structure for creating web services and APIs. In a web scraping project, Flask can be used to create a web interface that allows users to interact with the scraping functionality. This could include initiating scraping tasks, displaying results, or configuring scraping parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "User Interface (UI) for Web Scraping:\n",
    "Flask can be used to create a user-friendly front end for a web scraping tool. Instead of running scripts from the command line, users can interact with the web scraping functionality through a web browser, making the process more accessible to individuals who may not be comfortable with command-line interfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "RESTful APIs:\n",
    "Flask allows you to create RESTful APIs easily. In a web scraping project, you might want to expose certain functionalities as API endpoints. For example, you could design an API endpoint that accepts a URL, performs web scraping, and returns the extracted data in a structured format. This can be useful for integrating the scraping functionality into other applications or services."
